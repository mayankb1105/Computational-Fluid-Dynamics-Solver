To RUN the program download all python files in one folder namely:
210010039.py
Point_Jacobi.py
Point_Gauss_Siedel.py
Point_SOR.py
Temp.py
NOW RUN the file 210010039.py

This will give all the required data in the following order:
-> The number of iterations required to converge for different methods
-> Plot of Error vs iterations on log scale
-> Plot of temperature variation at x=0.5m midline
-> Plot of temperature deviation from exact solution as x=0.5m midline
-> Plot of temperature variation at y=1.0m midline
-> Plot of temperature deviation from exact solution as y=1.0m midline
-> Contour Plots for Point Jacobi, Point Gauss Seidel, Point Sucessive Over Relaxation, Exact Solution
